                    <p>🌌 MY ENCOUNTER WITH JESUS CHRIST – A TRUE LIFE TESTIMONY 🌌

                        Beloved, this may be hard to believe, but it’s 100% true.
                        
                        🗓️ On April 13th, 2025, I experienced something beyond the physical. I was suddenly overwhelmed by a dark and heavy presence. My body became paralyzed, and I struggled to move. In desperation, I began calling on the name of Jesus Christ.
                        
                        But the more I tried to say His name, the stronger the dark force became, trying to silence me.
                        
                        Then, something miraculous happened...
                        
                        ✨ HE APPEARED.
                        
                        Yes, I saw JESUS CHRIST. His face looked exactly like the one in Heinrich Hofmann’s painting. But in my vision, He appeared clothed in white and fringed in radiant purple, surrounded by heavenly beings, and the space around Him sparkled with stars.
                        
                        🌟 He stretched out His hand… and saved me.
                        
                        That moment changed everything.
                        
                        ✝️ JESUS CHRIST 👑 IS LORD.
                        ✝️ JESUS CHRIST 👑 IS REAL.
                        ✝️ JESUS CHRIST 👑 IS ETERNAL.
