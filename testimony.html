                    <p style="color: blue;" >It might be difficult to believe beloved but this is a true life story. On the Month of April 13th 2025, I was suppressed by a very dark power and I was finding it difficult to move my body at some point I started calling the name of Jesus Christ whenever I called his name, this the dark power become stronger and making sure that I am unable to pronounce the name Jesus Christ then he appeared and I saw him, yes I saw "JESUS CHRIST" This is exactly how His face looked when He appeared in my vision credit: ðŸ“¸ Heinrich Hofmann painting. However, He appeared smaller, His entire body was fringed in purple, accompanied by other heavenly beings, and the space around Him was filled with stars. Then, He stretched forth His hand to save me. JESUS CHRISTðŸ‘‘ IS LORD. JESUS CHRISTðŸ‘‘ IS REAL AND ETERNAL.</p>
